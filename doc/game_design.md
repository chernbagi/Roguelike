# Design Doc for Hero's Gambit

### Goals

Hero's Gambit is a fairly standard, simple roguelike. As such, the player gets
* character advancement/progression (on the mechanics side of things, not necessarily the story side)
  * some opponents that are too challenging to fight in the early stages of the game are easy to beat by the later stages of the game
* inventory management
* primary mob interactions are combat ('attack it' is never a bad choice from a story standpoint)
  * some tactically interesting combat
    * at the very least, players must make decisions about whether to fight or flee a given opponent
* exploration (of procedurally generated content)
* a simple framing story to engage the player and justify the avatar actions, but nothing to deep and little in the way of narrative progression
* a final battle/goal
* other standard roguelike experiences (permadeath, turn-based action, etc.)

### Story

A hero's nation is at war. In an act of desperation, the king has sent the hero to preemptively strike the opposing nation to allow for some chance at victory. The hero must kill as many enemies as possible before his own army's country arrives.

1. Kill as many soldiers as possible
2. Free hostages

### Mechanics
